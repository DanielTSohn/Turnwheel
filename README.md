<h1><i>Turnwheel</i></h1>
<h2><i>Turnwheel</i> is a tool to help users calculate builds for characters in the game Fire Emblem Engage!<h2>

Deciding how to allocate resources can be hard, <i>Turnwheel</i> is here to help decide how you should spend them on what units.
Users can build units and calculate their performance across chapters across the game to judge their performance across the game and to other units.
<i>Turnwheel</i> will handle many of the calculations on its own end. Some examples are calculating growths, fixed and random, combat simulation against enemies in a chapter, and thresholds to reach breakpoints in performance.
